link between nodes $i$ and $j$ is represented by a black dot in
position (i,j) of the matrix.  By raising this array to some power
some interesting properties can be observed.  For link apprentice all
words in a certain passage are hashed onto a table.  Other passages
that have similar hash tables are then linked to the original one.",
